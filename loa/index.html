<h1>My story on how to build digital library on a terabyte scale.</h1>

<!-- TODO: TOC -->

<h2>What is this page</h2>

<p>
    This page describes how I created the <b><a
        href="https://github.com/bottomless-archive-project/library-of-alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a></b>
    project. The project consist of an application suite that can enable its users to crawl, index and search hundreds
    of millions of documents, creating a library on epic proportions using only commodity hardware.
</p>

<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>
    It's a Friday night, after work. Everybody watches football, going to the gym or doing something with their life.
    Everybody except you. You are sitting in your room, reading an utterly boring sounding book called <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistulae_Morales_ad_Lucilium">"Moral letters
    to Lucilius"</a>. It was written by some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger">old dude</a>
    thousands of years ago. After reading it for about an hour, you realize that the title might be boring, but the
    contents are almost literally gold. Too bad there are not too many of these books survived the test of time.
</p>
<p>
    Okay, you might have come to a different realization, but this was my trigger event to start to work on this
    project. On that day, after a quick Google search I realized that only <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_literary_work">less than 1% of ancient texts</a> survived to the
    modern day. Sounds horrible isn't it? :)
