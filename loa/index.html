<h1>My story on how to build digital library on a terabyte scale.</h1>

<!-- TODO: TOC -->

<h2>What is this page</h2>

<p>
    This page describes how I created the <b><a
        href="https://github.com/bottomless-archive-project/library-of-alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a></b>
    project. The project consist of an application suite that can enable its users to crawl, index and search hundreds
    of millions of documents, creating a library on epic proportions using only commodity hardware.
</p>

<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>
    On a Friday night, after work, most people usually watch football, go to the gym or doing something useful with
    their life. Not everyone tough. I was an exception to this rule. As an introvert, I spent the last part of my day
    sitting in my room, reading an utterly boring sounding book called <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistulae_Morales_ad_Lucilium">"Moral letters to Lucilius"</a>. It was
    written by some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger">old dude</a>
    thousands of years ago. Definitely not the most fun sounding book fora Friday night. However, after reading it for
    about an hour, I realized that the title might be boring, but the contents are almost literally gold. Too bad there
    are not too many of these books survived the test of time.
</p>
<p>
    Realizing this unfortunate fact was my trigger event to start to work on this project. On that day, after a quick
    Google search I realized that only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_literary_work">less than 1% of
    ancient texts</a> survived to the modern day.
</p>

<h2>But how?</h2>
<p>
    At this point I had a couple (more like a dozen) failed projects under my belt, so I was not too fond to start
    working on a new one. I had to motivate myself. After I set the target of saving as many documents as possible, I
    wanted to have a more tangible but quite hard to achieve goal. I set a 100 million books as my initial goal, and a
    billion books as my ultimate target. Ohh how naive I was.
</p>
<p>
    Next day, after waking up, I immediately started typing on my old and trustworthy PC. //TODO
